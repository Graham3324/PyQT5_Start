Notes

Starting to look at PyQT5 as a Python UI
Need to get insatll insturctions in here:
    - Normal install with PIP
        PIP install PyQT5
    - Need to add the UI Designer tool, not part of tools pack now
        1. Save UI file from Designer
        2. Run pyuic5 -x ####.ui -o ####.py

More interesting approach that subclasses the Designer tool file
Need to run without creating an executable
    run pyuic5 #####.ui -o ####.py

Hookup code in test_ind.py, class for window in test1.py
